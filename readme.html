        <h1>Pixio!</h1>
        <p>Online Pictionary using MongoDB Atlas, Phaser and Realm. I coined it Pixio for no specific reason. Play a
            game of Pixio with friends everywhere on mobile and laptop! Go directly to <a target="_blank"
                href="https://mongo-draws-pzzoc.mongodbstitch.com/">https://mongo-draws-pzzoc.mongodbstitch.com/</a> or
            read how you can build this game yourself too.</p>

        <img src="./images/game_host.jpg" />

        <h1>Where do I get my inspiration from...</h1>
        <p>This pet project was heavily inspired on (read: completely borrowed) from the post at <a target="_blank"
                href="https://developer.mongodb.com/how-to/creating-multiplayer-drawing-game-phaser">https://developer.mongodb.com/how-to/creating-multiplayer-drawing-game-phaser</a>,
            a very nice and readable MongoDB Developer How-to article by Nic Raboy. So thanks a lot <a target="_blank"
                href="https://developer.mongodb.com/author/nic-raboy">Nic</a>!</p>

        <h1>Gimme the code!</h1>
        <p>The code can of course be found in the original How-to article. I stored my version in a GitHub repository at
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/taatuut/pixio">https://github.com/taatuut/pixio</a><br />
            You can just use the code from the Pixio repo and it works out of the box after meeting these requirements:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Setup your own MongoDB Atlas cluster (available as free tier)</li>
            <li>Create your own Realm app (available in the free tier)</li>
            <li>Host the code somewhere (just use Realm Hosting for it, you are creating the app there anyway).</li>
            <li>Replace the value for realmAppId in the <code>index.html</code> file with your own Realm App id! More in
                where to find that later. If you don't use your own Realm app, your pixios end up in my database because
                I did not take my Realm App id out of the code ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h1>How do I get this working?</h1>
        <p>Check out the readme.html in the Pixio repo or online at <a target="_blank"
                href="https://mongo-draws-pzzoc.mongodbstitch.com/readme.html">https://mongo-draws-pzzoc.mongodbstitch.com/readme.html</a>
        </p>

        <h2>Application</h2>
        <p>If you are not using the code from the Pixio repo, then click above link and follow the tutorial until you
            created the <code>index.html</code> and <code>game.js</code> file up to the point
            where it says 'You did it!'.</p>

        <h2>MongoDB Atlas</h2>
        <p>If you don't have a (free) MongoDB Atlas cluster running yet, go to <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.mongodb.com/cloud">https://www.mongodb.com/cloud</a> and click <b>[ Try MongoDB Cloud
                Now
                ]</b> and signup. If you already have a cluster up, login there. In your Atlas cluster, create a
            database <code>mongo-draws</code> with a collection <code>game</code>.</p>

        <img src="./images/mongo-draws_game.jpg" />

        <p><i>Note: make sure to whitelist access to your cluster for the relevant IP addresses.</i></p>

        <h2>Realm</h2>
        <p>To create a new Realm App, click the Realm link at the top of the page.</p>

        <img src="./images/realm.jpg" />

        <p>Then click [ Create a New App ] and give it the name <code>mongo-draws</code> and connect it to the cluster
            where you created the <code>mongo-draws</code> database just a moment ago.</p>

        <img src="./images/realmcreate.jpg" />

        <p>Now the page for the newly created app opens. Enable anonymous authentication by clicking the Providers tab
            in the Users area of the Realm dashboard, then click <b>[ Edit ]</b> on the line saying 'Allow users to log
            in anonymously'.</p>

        <img src="./images/realmanon.jpg" />

        <p>Set the switch to on and click <b>[ Save ]</b></p>

        <img src="./images/realmanonsave.jpg" />

        <p>
            Anonymous access is now enabled, but must be deployed to take effect. Click <b>[ Review & Deploy]</b>, in
            the
            window that opens you can review the code changes, then click <b>[ Deploy ]</b>. You will see a message
            appear with
            timestamp saying 'Deployment was successful!'.
        </p>

        <img src="./images/realmdeploy.jpg" />

        <p>
            With the anonymous authentication effectively enabled, we can define the read and write rules of our
            documents.
        </p>


        <p>Go to the Rules area, confirm that 'No template' is the selected item and click <b>[ Configure Collection
                ]</b></p>

        <img src="./images/realmrules.jpg" />

        <p>Within the Rules area of the Realm dashboard, create two rules for the <code>game</code> collection. </p>

        <img src="./images/realmrulesowner.jpg" />

        <p>The first rule is for the document owners, give them read and write ability. Non-owners watching Pixio need
            read access. Make sure to specify that the <code>owner_id</code> of the document is to be mapped to the
            document owner, during the process of creating rules.</p>

        <img src="./images/owneredit.jpg" />
        <br />
        <img src="./images/owner.jpg" />

        <p>First finish owner, then click <b>[ + NEW ROLE ]</b>> and create non-owner role.</p>

        <img src="./images/nonowner.jpg" />

        <p>You will end up with something like this:
        </p>

        <img src="./images/realmrulesdone.jpg" />

        <p>
            Don't forget to save and deploy. MongoDB Atlas and Realm are now ready to roll with you in Pixio!
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are following the How-to, it is time to go back here for some more edits to the <code>game.js</code>
            and <code>index.html</code> files. If you use the code from the Pixio repo, you are almost done. In both
            cases you need to add your own Realm App id as the last step. To get that id, go to the Realm applications
            overview to find your <code>mongo-draws</code> app there too.
        </p>

        <img src="./images/realmappsoverview.jpg" />

        <p>
            If you go back in your app, you can copy the app id you need to put in the <code>index.html</code> file
            replacing the REALM_APP_ID value in the new Game property "realmAppId" (if you use the code from the Pixio
            repo, there might already be another value, just replace that one).
        </p>

        <img src="./images/copyappid.jpg" />
        <br />
        <img src="./images/REALM_APP_ID.jpg" />

        <p>
            When done, make sure to save all your efforts and deploy this code somewhere on a webserver.</p>

        <p>Hint: use <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/hosting/">Realm Hosting</a><a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/hosting/">https://docs.mongodb.com/realm/hosting/</a>
            an option available in the Realm app page too.
        </p>

        <img src="./images/realmhosting.jpg" />

        <p>
            Enabling hosting gives you the possibility to upload content through the Realm UI or by using the Realm CLI.
            It comes with a default index.html (<i>Hello, World!</i>) that we will overwrite when uploading our content.

        </p>
        <img src="./images/helloworld.jpg" />

        <p>
            Hosting also gives you a custom name for your app (in my case it is <a target="_blank"
                href="https://mongo-draws-pzzoc.mongodbstitch.com/">https://mongo-draws-pzzoc.mongodbstitch.com/</a>),
            and you can even hook up a domain name you own.
        </p>

        Again, also after uploading content to Realm Hosting, don't forget to review and deploy the changes.

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>
            The cool thing about this exercise, is that I am able to create a real life online running multi-player game
            in less than an hour without the need to setup any server, compute or storage resources for the database as
            this is part of the MongoDB Atlas cluster setup, and Realm offers both the possibilities to create your app
            (with users, rules), and to host the code. This writeup
            actually took way more time than bringing the game up and running... And even my family is
            interested in the results of something work related this time! </p>
        <p>But kidding aside, this user friendly serverless Cloud approach just connecting the
            necessary components is the way to be up and running quickly with any application. Reducing time to market with your next killer product, while addressing the business goals in the blink of an eye. Now all I need to do is sharpen my
            drawing skills :-)

        </p>
        <p><i>Happy Pixio, now go play!</i>
