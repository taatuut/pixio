# Pixio!
Online Pictionary using MongoDB Atlas, Phaser and Realm, I coined it Pixio for no specific reason. Play a game Pixio with friends everywhere on mobile and laptop!

# Where do I get my inspiration from...
Heavily inspired on (or: very borrowed from) https://developer.mongodb.com/how-to/creating-multiplayer-drawing-game-phaser, a very nice and readable MongoDB Developer How-to article by Nic Raboy. So thanks a lot Nic! https://developer.mongodb.com/author/nic-raboy

# Gimme the code!
The code can of course be found in the original How-to. I stored my version in GitHub at https://github.com/taatuut/pixio
You can just use this code and it will work out of the box after you:
- Setup your own MongoDB Atlas cluster (available as free tier)
- Create your own Realm app (available in the free tier)
- Host the code somewhere (just use Realm Hosting for it, you are creating the app there anyway).
- Replace the value for realmAppId in the index.html file with your own Realm App id! If you don't, your pixios end up in my database because I did not take Realm App id out of the code ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

# How do I get this working?
